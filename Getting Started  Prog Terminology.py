#Please write a program which asks the user for a word and then prints out the number of characters, if there was more than one typed in.

""" Examples of expected behaviour:

Sample output
Please type in a word: hey
There are 3 letters in the word hey
Thank you!

Sample output
Please type in a word: banana
There are 6 letters in the word banana
Thank you!

Sample output
Please type in a word: b
Thank you! """

#When programming in Python, often we need to change the data type of a value. For example, a floating point number can be converted into an integer with the function int:

""" print("The temperature is", temperature)

print("...and rounded down it is", int(temperature))
Sample output

Please type in a temperature: 5.15
The temperature is 5.15
...and rounded down it is 5

Sample output

Please type in a temperature: 8.99
The temperature is 8.99
...and rounded down it is 8 """

#Please write a program which asks the user for a floating point number and then prints out the integer part and the decimal part separately. Use the Python int function. You can assume the number given by the user is always greater than zero.

""" An example of expected behaviour:

Sample output
Please type in a number: 1.34
Integer part: 1
Decimal part: 0.34 """
